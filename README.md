Dark Mountain is a Unity-built pc game with an emphasis on sound design and echo-location.
In the game, you play as a rescue patrol officer tasked with finding lost mountain goers. The mountain is dark, and finding them can only be done by listening carefully for their voices.

The game was built as a final project for a game programming class.
